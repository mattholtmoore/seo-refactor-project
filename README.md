## Description
On this site, I improved it's overall accessibilty and formatting issues. I made sure all links work. I consolidated the CSS by refactoring the code and eliminating excessive duplicate line items. I edited HTML by choosing more semantic elements to replace div elements since they hold no specific value. Better for SEO experience. I made sure that all images have alt attributes and I created a desriptive title. I have made the site content more readible and succinct within HTML and CSS by implementing these changes.
